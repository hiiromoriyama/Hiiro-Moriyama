                  <h2>Feathers Before Dawn</h2>
                  <p>I was born on the 32nd of October, 1998. That’s the three-hundred-and-five-and-a-halfth day of the year in the Gregorian calendar. Some people say that day doesn’t exist, but I like it better than the 1st of November. The 1st of November is the Day of the Dead in many places. I don’t like that. It makes me feel strange. I don’t like feeling strange.</p>
                  <p>When adults ask me what I want to be when I grow up, I say, “I don’t know,” or “I haven’t thought about it.” Sometimes I just stay quiet. I think adults think too much about the future. They want to plan everything, like it's a puzzle they can solve if they try hard enough. But I don’t always know what the picture on the puzzle is supposed to be.</p>
                  <p>I tried to decide once. I wanted to be a farmer because I played a farming video game and I was good at it. I liked watching the crops grow. They grow in patterns. I like patterns. So I asked my mum to buy me some chicks. She did. I thought I would start with two. Two is a good number because it’s even and it makes pairs. Pairs make babies. I wanted the chicks to make babies.</p>
                  <p>But I had a problem. I didn’t know if they were boy and girl chicks. They looked the same. I asked my mum, and she didn’t know either. So I asked my science teacher.</p>
                  <p>He said, “You have to wait until they’re older.” He didn’t know either. Adults say they know things, but sometimes they don’t. Sometimes they guess. That makes me nervous.</p>
                  <p>I said I would wait. But then my little brother gave the chicks a bath in the shower. Chicks don’t like showers. The next day they didn’t move. Mum said they died from the cold.</p>
                  <p>I said, “What do you mean, died?”</p>
                  <p>She said, “It means they won’t move or breathe ever again, because something inside them is gone.”</p>
                  <p>I said, “What was it?”</p>
                  <p>She said, “Their soul.”</p>
                  <p>I don’t know what a soul is. I don’t think she knows either. I think people say “soul” when they don’t know what else to say. I don’t like when people talk about things they don’t understand. It makes me feel like I’m the only one who notices.</p>
                  <p>I was angry at my brother, but he was only two, and he didn’t mean it. So I tried again. On my birthday, Mum said she would buy me a Barbie doll, but I didn’t want a doll.</p>
                  <p>I said, “Mum, what can I do with a doll?”</p>
                  <p>She said, “It’s a toy. You can play with it.”</p>
                  <p>But I said, “I want to be a farmer.”</p>
                  <p>So she bought me two more chicks. I asked the man at the shop to give me a boy chick and a girl chick. He said he did. I named them Marky and Sally. I also borrowed a poultry book from the school library. It had pictures. I like pictures. They don’t talk too much.</p>
                  <p>I imagined a big farm where Marky and Sally and their babies would run around. I imagined it every day. But then Sally died. I don’t know why. I said maybe she was just tired.</p>
                  <p>I brought Marky to my grandmother’s house. I didn’t bring him back because it was raining, and I was scared he would get cold and die like the others. My grandmother took pictures and sent them to me. Marky grew tall—tall as my knee. But he wasn’t a he. Marky was a girl. We still called her Marky.</p>
                  <p>When I came back, I thought Marky would remember me. But she didn’t. She didn’t remember my smell or my voice or my face. She looked at me and ran. She bit my neck. It hurt a lot. My grandmother pulled her away. After that, we weren’t friends anymore. She stayed with my grandmother until she died. I don’t know when that was.</p>
                  <p>Then I decided maybe I can’t be a farmer. It’s hard. You have to go outside and touch dirt and animals. And animals die. I watched a documentary about dogs once. They were hurt by their owners. Some of them died. The word “died” was in the video a lot.</p>
                  <p>So then I wanted to understand death. I asked my mum for a book about it. She couldn’t find one, but she gave me a big book about philosophy. It had small letters and hard words. I read it for a whole year. Not more, not less. One exact year. I wrote it down.</p>
                  <p>I had to look up lots of words. Words like prescient and asceticism and aphorism. I didn’t like all the words, but I liked learning them.</p>
                  <p>Then my mum died.</p>
                  <p>She didn’t say goodbye. No one told me why. I only felt a sharp pain in my chest, like the day the chicks died, but this time it was one hundred and twenty-three times stronger. I counted. Maybe she was tired. Maybe she went to sleep like Sally did.</p>
                  <p>I still don’t know what death is. But now I know that some chickens are auto-sexing. That means you can tell if they’re boys or girls when they hatch. Not all of them, just some.</p>
                  <p>Now, when adults ask me what I want to be when I grow up, I say, “I don’t want to be an adult. Adulthood is too heavy.” My mum once told me that the doctor said my heart didn’t beat for the first 13 seconds after I was born. I always think about that when I’m alone. Maybe it was 13 seconds. Maybe it was 12,999 milliseconds. I don’t know. The doctor said it was a miracle. I remember saying, “Wow.” I meant it.</p>
                  <p>Also, 486 years before I was born, on the same day, the Sistine Chapel ceiling by Michelangelo was opened to the public. That’s amazing. But also, 43 years before I was born, on the same day, the Vietnam War started. That’s sad. So I think you just choose what matters to you.</p>
                  <p>That’s why I say I was born on the 32nd of October. Not the 1st of November. The 1st is too crowded with meaning. Too much about death. I don’t want to be relevant. Sometimes I think maybe it would’ve been better if the egg I was in didn’t hatch.</p>
